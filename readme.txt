It allows you to modify unavailable WooCommerce email texts without overriding the email template.

== Description ==

Even though WooCommerce allows you to modify *some* email texts, it doesn't let you change all of them.  
The only way seems to be with template override, which not everybody knows how to do, and even if you know, it looks like an overkill to create a whole template to change "Hi" to "Hello."  

A simple plug-and-play plugin that adds the missing texts from the email template.  
It automatically pulls all the localization texts from the template, so it can get them even if future updates introduce new texts.

This plugin requires [WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/) to be installed and active.  
You can locate the new fields in the exact location where you manage the email template.  
From the Dashboard, WooCommerce -> Settings -> Emails -> Manage (Whichever email template you want).

You can use the [Preview Emails for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-preview-emails/) plugin for quicker testing.  
This plugin adds the option to preview any email template, so you don't need to create an order whenever you want to check an email template.

== Screenshots ==

1. At the bottom, you can see the added field for New Order.
2. Customer Invoice has four texts. You can see the first one with a different value.
3. This is the default text of the Customer Invoice initial text.
4. This is the modified text of the Customer Invoice initial text.
